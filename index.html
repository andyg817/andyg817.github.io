                <h2>Problem Statment: Routine Mintinance</h2>
                <p>
                    People are often too busy to remember to routinely maintain their appliances or do not want to pay for it to be maintained. Our solution should provide our users with a reminder of when to do maintenance and should teach them how if they so desire.
